Instructions to use the Get-AllRDMs script to make a report of all Virtual and Physical Raw Device Mapping

1. Copy the folder RDM to your Desktop on any of the Jump Servers. 

2. This folder contains 3 files:

	- Get-AllRDMs.ps1 script
	- vclist.txt this is the file with the list of vCenters
	- This instruction file
	
3. Edit the vclist.txt to add/remove vCenters. I have included all vCenters in our scope by default

4. If you want to check RDM on WSSDOM and BMS environments first make sure you're logged into their firewalls

5. Right click the get-all-rdm.ps1 and edit it with Notepad or Powershell ISE

6. Go to lines 4,5 and 7,8 to edit the US and CPC user/password variables with your credentials. Example:

	$ususer        = '<your US\ id>'
	$uspass        = '<your password>'

	$cpcuser       = '<your CPC\ id>'
	$cpcpass       = '<your password>'
	
	Note: Don't remove the single quotes! Keep them
	
5. Once you have the vclist.txt ready and you're logged into WSSDOM and BMS firewalls open Powershell as Administrator
(right-click the Powershell icon on your taskbar and click Run As Administrator)

6. Change directory to your Desktop path. Example: cd c:\users\aemonzon\desktop\RDM

7. Once you're placed in the RDM directory run the script by typing .\get-all-rdm.ps1

8. The script will read the vclist.txt, will attempt to connect to each vCenter and for each vCenter it will gather the list of VMs with RDM attached

9. The script will generate a csv file with the list of RDM found. 

10. Once you're done and happy with the results remove your passwords from the get-all-rdm.ps1 script!
